THE PREMISE
htdx, yet another project created from irritation
I search web everyday, look up for different info

It feels too bloated for me
All top 10 Google search results are either a forum thread or an article 
say I need to create a live USB in linux   ------------------------------------------------------------------
looking for command + flags for this one   >    ゝ¨   maybe the solution is to use different search engine? <
you hit URL, oh no client-side rendering   >     ル  <- *tried to draw a duck here*                         <
you wait, it loads, click off all popups   ------------------------------------------------------------------
you scroll an entire damn page down, look there it is! your `dd' command

I want to experiment with a single document content
info graphics, HTML documents, markdown you name it
restrict content to the page size, remove java-shit
no navigation, no footer - zero bloat, only content

DEVLOG
I consider following medium
・HTML document                       +-----------------------------------------------+
・txt files (*we are here)  <--------- I really like the 2D freedom in raw txt files  |
・graphics                            |                      you can very easily do   |     
　                                    |                        cool stuff like this  ---> [ insert cool ASCII art here ]
　                                    +-----------------------------------------------+   [   or something like that   ]


                                                                        

                                                            but sure, this text placing is quite distracting

Raw text is great, HTML can add extra magic
for disabling text wrapping, links to docs
positioning,          CENTERING                      css stuff
accessability, meta info, so you TTS won't
repeat dash-dash-dash when listening web
